## Overview
Music classification is a challenging task in data science. This project aims to create a machine learning model that categorizes music samples into different genres systematically. It attempts to predict the genre by taking an audio signal as input. The goal of automating music classification is to make song selection faster and less laborious. Manually classifying songs or music requires listening to a large number of songs and then selecting the genre. This is both time-consuming and difficult. By using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this project aims to automate the process, reducing manual effort and time.
